Zetta Security System
=====================

This repository will allow you to follow along with the [IoT Security System Recipe](http://www.zettajs.org/recipes/2014/09/18/IoT-Security-System.html) on zettajs.org.

To move through the steps of this repo, update your place in the commit history to specific tags. This is how you get back to the initial state of the tutorial:  

```bash
git checkout -f step-0
```

Moving to step 1 will be called out in the tutorial at the link above, and will look like this:

```bash
git checkout -f step-1
```

You can always get back to here with `git checkout master`.

`step-4` can be used as a good project prototype.
